        <h1>
            Which Came First—Better Education or Better Health?
        </h1>
         
        <h4>
            words for pie charts
        </h4>
        <p>
            The following donut charts are illustration of the distribution of Monthly Household Expenditure by Type of Goods and Services and Highest Qualification Attained of Main Income Earner.
         </p>
         <p>
            We can see that every family have around 1/3 of the total spend is on food related items. Orange stands for the food consumption. The magenta stands for food services.  The blue bar is the percentage of ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES AND TOBACCO, which are relatively small percentage compared to normal food consumptions. 
         </p>
         <h2>
            Which group has the highest percentage?
         </h2>
         <p>
            bar 1: With the bar chart, we can see that the percentage of ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES AND TOBACCO decreases as the education level increases. The people with “no qualification” spends the biggest percentage, which the people with “University” qualification spends the least. 
         </p>
         <h2>
            Does this mean people with lower education are less healthy aware?
         </h2>

        <p>
           bar 2:We decide to look on the monthly income of each group.

           From the bar we can see the income increases dramatically with the education level goes up. The average income of people with “university degree “is almost ten times more than people with “no qualification”.           
        </p>

        <p>
           bar 3: We multiply the monthly income with the percentage on ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES AND TOBACCO. Surprisingly, the actual amount money “University” group spent is much higher than “no qualification”. The highest amount of spent is the “polytechnic” group. 
        </p>

        <h2>
            Apparently, people with higher education are less healthy aware. 
        </h2>
        <p>
            bar 4:If we want to decrease the national consumption ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES AND TOBACCO of Singapore, which education group shall we target the most? The “polytechnic” group?

            To answer this question, we collected another set of data: the pollution of each education group that living in HDB. 
            
        </p>

        <p>
            bar 5:Then, we multiply the population with the monthly spent on ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES AND TOBACCO. Here’s final result:
        </p>

        <p>
            The winner is the “university” group. The group with the highest education degree contributes the most to the national consuming of ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES AND TOBACCO. Finally, we have our conclusion: if Singapore government want to reduce the consumption of ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES AND TOBACCO, they should put more emphasis on health education to the people with “university” qualification.
        </p>
        
        <h2>
            Is this the end of the story? Are people with“university”qualifications more concerned for health issue?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Here’s still one more parameter to be considered: The big pricing range of different kinds of ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES AND TOBACCO. Someone can spend 100 dollars on 10 packs of cigarettes, while someone else can spent 200 dollars on one pack. The person spends less money is the heavier smoker in this case. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Unfortunately, we don’t have the price dataset of the consumption. We couldn’t see the actual quantity, which indicates the actual level of “un-healthiness” each group of people.
